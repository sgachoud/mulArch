* DESCRIPTION:
*   OpenMP Example - Hello World - C/C++ Version
*   In this simple example, the master thread forks a parallel region.
*   All threads in the team obtain their unique thread number and
*   a random number and print them. Only the master thread prints the
*   total number of threads.  Two OpenMP library routines are used to
*   obtain the number of threads and each thread's number. set_clock
*   and elapsed_time functions are used to measure the time. The three
*   *_rand functions are used to manage the random number generator.
